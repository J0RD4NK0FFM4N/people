"My favorite “learning moments” at Harvard have been when I am able to draw from knowledge from previous courses and relate these ideas to topics being discussed in a current class. Forming connections across disciplines is when I feel that I’ve truly “learned” something, as the ideas/concepts/thoughts floating around in my head start to feel more concrete and grounded in something.
