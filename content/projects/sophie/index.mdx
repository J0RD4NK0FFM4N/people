"To me, 'learning' is the lifelong process of acquiring new information, picking up new skills, trying new experiences, and expanding your worldview. I feel so fortunate to work at a place where learning and improving learning in all its forms is the central goal!!"

Sophie is a Senior concentrating in History & Literature. This Spring she will be working on creating a version of her Senior Thesis as a data storytelling toolkit. During the fall, she found several models for this type of multimodal academic communciation, deconstructed them, and began reconstructing her own in order to learn the skills necessary to "write" in this new medium.

Ask Sophie about codeLab, reactLab, and Friday morning coffee talks!
