The Learning Lab is an intergenerational team composed of staff and undergraduate and graduate fellows, as well as a studio space built to support creative approaches to teaching and learning. In collaboration with faculty, the Learning Lab team explores, designs, and builds innovative materials, assignments, and activities for Harvard courses.

Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows (or LLUFs) are a core part of our team and mission. As students at the College, LLUFs often have terrific intuitions about the pedagogy that will most engage and appeal to their peers, and they use this expertise as learners to help the Bok Center’s faculty partners design and test new learning experiences for their courses. Given that many of these assignments and activities involve new, or at least, alternative modes of communication—drawing, speaking, coding, 3D modeling, video-editing—the LLUFs have the opportunity to explore and become proficient in a remarkably broad range of media and tools for communicating academic content.

While many LLUFs only come to the Learning Lab later in their time at Harvard—often after visiting our space in one of their courses—Sam Benkelman ‘20 worked with the Learning Lab all four years at Harvard. Of his work at the Learning Lab he said:
“I feel like I’m a more creative thinker. I’m willing to trust that creativity and that’s thanks in large part to the awesome leadership here, and the welcoming environment--forming working relationships with people here. I think the term thrown around is an “intergenerational community” and that’s a huge opportunity for me to gain insights from peoples’ experience from just every field, and I am seeing that on a daily basis. It’s a huge thing that I’m really appreciative of.”

The LLUFs continued to play crucial roles for the Bok Center as we rallied to support the move online in the spring. If anything, their feedback became even more essential, as the entire Harvard teaching and learning community was grappling with new digital tools and platforms. The LLUFs were able to test these tools quickly, to give us feedback on them, and even to produce documentation and tutorials for both instructors and students.
